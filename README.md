YAML awesomeness

> A curated list of YAML resources

## Overview

YAML is one of the most underrated "human-readable" data representation formats in existence.
* Most developers who use it had a negative first-impression of the format, usually because of the syntax.
* Some dislike the fact that YAML depends on indentation for specifying scope.
* Some consider YAML to be superfluous: "XML and JSON fit the bill nicely enough".
* Some have either never heard of YAML or are intimidated by the fact that it is not as famous as JSON or XML.
